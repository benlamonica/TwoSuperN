I wanted to see how long it would take me to mimic one of the popular apps on the AppStore. I did it for fun, not to make money, and so I've made the app available for free and without any ads. I put this source code here for educational purposes. I still retain the full copyright, and ask that you not use the code in anything that you are planning on uploading to the AppStore.

If you want to see the app in action, you may download it from:
